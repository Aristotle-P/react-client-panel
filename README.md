## About this app
React/Redux application to manage clients and owed balances from them. Using Google's Firebase as a back-end to persist data and authenticate logins. Fully responsive and styled with Bootstrap/CSS3


## If you plan to clone this repo
Depenencies in this repo relating to Firebase seem to be tied to Node v10. I currently have no plans to update them as they work in production and there are no pressing security issues.
